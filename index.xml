      <description>Some time ago, I decided to migrate Secure QR Reader to Jetpack Compose (in the rest of the article, I will call it Compose, for brevity). QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader that I developed some years ago after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require sneaky, strange, and useless permissions.
The app was basic and fully working with the old View system, but I wanted to move to Compose to experience the entire migration process.</description>

      <title>Organize your Views: SwiftUI edition</title>
      <link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2023/organize-view-swiftui-edition/</link>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2023/organize-view-swiftui-edition/</guid>
      <description>One of the pros of SwiftUI, and generally of declarative UI frameworks, is the capability of defining the UI with the same programming language the application uses.
With SwiftUI, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from somewhere else, resulting in a decrease of context switching between two different environments (Storyboards and Swift code, for example)
But “with great power comes great responsibility”, and a codebase can quickly become a nightmare without some structure and organization.</description>

      <title>How to create a parameterized base test class in Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2023/parameterized-kotlin-base-test/</link>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2023/parameterized-kotlin-base-test/</guid>
      <description>One exciting feature of JUnit 4 (and 5 as well, but this post will be focused on JUnit 4) is the possibility of running the same test with different input arguments.
That is made possible by a custom test runner called Parameterized, which will inject the provided arguments in the constructor of the test class. Instead, the different arguments must be defined in the companion object of the test class.</description>

This project soon became a personal playground for a Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app and in a previous article, I journaled all the steps that lead me to a satisfying (at least for that time) shared app architecture.

      <description>QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader designed and developed with a focus on privacy.
I decided to develop it after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents.
The app is very simple (the aim is to scan a code and open the link, only this!) and it does not require sneaky, strange and useless permissions just for the sake of stealing your data. There aren&amp;rsquo;t ads, trackers of any sort and what do you scan remains on your phone.</description>

      <description>A mobile application to manage and create tournaments. Friends Tournament will help to generate videogames tournament, sports tournament, board games tournament, whatever type of tournament. All you need to do is to provide the number of players, the number of matches, and the number of players that can play at the same time. That&amp;rsquo;s all! Friends Tournament will then generate the matches and the rounds for you. Then you can keep track of the players&amp;rsquo; score and a nice leaderboard is automatically generated.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I opened my Kotlin Multiplatform pet project MoneyFlow on a different machine than usual. When I tried to run the app on the iOS simulator on Xcode, the build failed with a very strange error: &amp;ldquo;The operation couldn&amp;rsquo;t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime&amp;rdquo;.
This was a very strange issue because the JDK is installed and everything is working on the command line and Android Studio/IntelliJ.</description>

      <title>Building an XCFramework on Kotlin Multiplatform from Kotlin 1.5.30</title>

      <description>A few days ago, Kotlin 1.5.30 has been released. One of the features contained in the release is the official support for XCFrameworks on Kotlin Multiplatform.
XCFramework is a binary that can contain multiple platform-specific variants (even for iOS and macOS at the same time). It has been introduced by Apple during the WWDC 2019 as a replacement for FatFrameworks.
Before Kotlin 1.5.30, an XCFramework could be created only by running the xcrun command that will pack the frameworks for every different required platform into an XCFramework.</description>

      <description>When you start integrating Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) in an existing project you most likely don’t have a mono-repo structure (and making a refactor to achieve this kind of architecture will not be easy). An example of architecture is the following, with a repository for every platform.
To understand how to integrate KMP into existing code, give a look at my previous article: “Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project”</description>

      <description>Gitlab CI/CD offers the possibility to create a pipeline, which runs when something changes in the repository. A pipeline consists of one or more stages that run in order and in these stages, for example, it is possible to build the project, run the tests, create the artifacts, etc. For more information about Gitlab CI/CD, I suggest you look over the documentation.
These out-of-the-box solutions really simplify the work to be done to have a CI up and running.</description>

      <description>Today I want to share KMP FatFramework Cocoa, a Gradle plugin for Kotlin Multiplatform projects that generate a FatFramework for iOS targets and manages the publishing process in a CocoaPod Repository.
The plugin is born from a set of unbundled Gradle tasks that I wrote to manage the building and the publishing process of Kotlin Multiplatform libraries for iOS that we use at Uniwhere and Revelop. The libraries are published in a FatFramework that contains the code for every required architecture (real devices use the Arm64 architecture, while the simulator uses the host computer architecture which in most of the cases is X64).</description>

      <description>After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. That’s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).
This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article).
When starting a new blank KMP project it is easier to have a mono-repo structure like this:</description>

Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter
https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/
So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.
In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</description>

      <description>It’s been a few years since I started writing this blog, and I quite like sharing my thoughts and experiences. After a short while spent on Medium, I decided I wanted to be the sole owner of my content, so I started experimenting with different solutions and ideas. After I finally landed on the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; tech architecture (I know, I’m lying. There’s no perfect solution and Future Me will most likely refactor and (over)re-engineer the current solution), I started to seek the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; writing setup.</description>

      <description>If you are starting a project with Kotlin Multiplatform and you want to share the network layer, the best way to go is definitely with Ktor. But if you don’t want to share the entire network layer but maybe only the DTOs? There could be many reasons for wanting this. Maybe you are starting to integrate Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) into an existing project and the work for sharing the entire network layer is simply too much.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to work on (yet another) side project: Money Flow. As the name suggests, this is an application to help me track all the expenses and incomes. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought and designed it almost a year ago but only now I&amp;rsquo;ve found the time to start writing actual code.
A first design iteration, that will change a bit
I’ve decided to make this project a personal playground for a Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app.</description>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2020/my-2cents-cross-platform/</guid>
      <description>During my journey as a mobile developer, I had the chance to try and give a look at some cross-platform solutions both for work and fun reasons. Today, I want to share my thoughts and considerations about them and why/when you should use cross-platform. I hope that these thoughts will be helpful to anyone that is in the process of choosing the right solution for their product.
Disclaimer: in this article, I will share some opinions based on my experience and they can apply to your situation or not.</description>

      <description>Last week my parents asked me to download to their phones a simple QR Reader. So I opened the Play Store and I started to search an easy to use application, without lot&amp;rsquo;s of noise (oh, I mean intrusive ads..) and without ulterior motives. Well, I wandered around the Play Store for an hour without finding an answer.
Some apps will require all the imaginable permission only to scan a QR code.</description>

      <description>Today I want to share Friends Tournament, a side project that I have been working on for the past year during my spare time.
Friends Tournament is a simple application that will help you to manage and organize tournaments with your friends. You can use it to generate videogames tournament, sports tournament, board games tournament, whatever type of tournament do you want. All you need to do is to provide the number of players, the number of matches and the numbers of player that can play at the same time.</description>

      <description>Which framework should I use? How to build UIs? How do things work under the hood? These are the types of questions that I&amp;rsquo;ve answered during the series of articles about Flutter and React Native.
Some time ago I started learning Flutter for fun reasons and at the same time, I (had to) started learning React Native for work reasons. While learning and using them, I started to see some differences and some common concepts between them.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth and last part of this article series about React Native and Flutter.
In the first episode, we have introduced the two frameworks with some history and with a comparison between the languages that they use.
In the second episode, we have talked about User Interfaces and how to build them.
In the third episode, we went deeper under the hood to understand how things work.
And now it&amp;rsquo;s time to wrap things up by trying to understand how to choose the right framework for you.</description>

      <description>Today I want to share my setup of note-taking that I use during conferences.
Unfortunately, I’m not the guy able to take the beautiful, colorful sketchnotes that you can see on Twitter. That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc.</description>

So, this tutorial is no longer recommended because it explains how to publish an Android library to JCenter.
I suggested you follow this guide written by Márton Braun.

      <description>The recent revamp of the Material Design has introduced new beautiful items, for example, the Bottom App Bar.

With Flutter is super easy to implement like shown in the official documentation. However, for me, the tricky part is to combine it with swipeable tabs so, in this article, I’ll explain all the steps that I’ve followed to obtain it.
Here’s a spoiler of the final result:</description>

Some weeks ago I released a new version of the RSS Parser Library and I talked about the update in a blog post.
RSS Parser 2.0: bye bye Async Task, welcome Coroutines This update brought a huge change in the infrastructure of the library. SPOILER: Kotlin and coroutines. Today, in this post I want to talk about the transition process and all the decisions that I have made to develop this new version.</description>

      <description>Finally, I found some time to sit down and work on my library RSS Parser. Before starting to describe all the cool stuff that I’ve introduced with this update, I want to thank you all for the support. In fact this year, the library exceeded 100 stars on Github, that seems a little goal but it means a lot to me.
I wrote this library back in 2016 and now in 2018, the code was “ugly” compared to all the coolest stuff provided by Kotlin.</description>

      <description>This Android application has been developed during an University Class and the aim was to provide a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; to the Cyber Robot, a cheap sensorless toy robot sell by Clementoni. More information about the robot can be found on the official website. More specifically, the aim was to reverse-engineer the communication protocol of the robot via the Bluetooth HCI snoop log and then build an app that guides it to reach a target object that is framed by the phone’s camera.</description>
