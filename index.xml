      <description>Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day. It started as an experimental technology, then alpha, beta and now it&amp;rsquo;s on the path of becoming stable. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; We constantly read of new companies and teams that are using KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: why pick KMP over any other cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll answer these questions, clarifying all the doubts and making you ready to use and love Kotlin Multiplatform.</description>

      <title>Using annotations to improve iOS APIs on Kotlin Multiplatform</title>
      <link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2023/objc-annotiations-better-kmp-api/</link>

      <description>Kotlin 1.8 has introduced new annotations to improve the interoperability of Kotlin with Objective-C and Swift:
@ObjCName: allows to customize the name that will be used in Swift or Objective-C @HiddenFromObjC: allows hiding a Kotlin declaration from Objective-C (and Swift). @ShouldRefineInSwift: it marks a Kotlin declaration as swift_private in the Objective-C API, allowing to replace it with a wrapper written in Swift. You can see the release announcement for more details about the interoperability improvements introduced with Kotlin 1.</description>

      <description>As mobile developers, we often see the backend world as something magical that &amp;ldquo;does things&amp;rdquo;. But what if I tell you that you can easily build a backend even if mobile is your thing?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;With this talk, I want to show how it is possible to bring your mobile knowledge (and shift it a little bit) to build a backend with Kotlin and Ktor. I will show how to structure the project, set up Dependency Injection, connect to a database and test everything to have a working backend ready to be deployed.</description>

      <description>If you want to start adopting Jetpack Compose in an existing, large codebase worked on by multiple teams, you can’t just add the dependency and start creating composables right away. In such projects, there are already established conventions and architectural decisions that such a revolutionary change might disrupt. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this talk, we will share our journey of integrating Compose into the TIER app while offering practical tips for tackling common challenges that arise when working with large-scale codebases, like: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Getting rid of Data binding,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Migrating to a Unidirectional Data Flow architecture,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Going Compose-first with a design system,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Enabling Compose in a multimodule world,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Getting Android engineers on board with the changes</description>

      <description>Back in 2016, out of my raising passion for Android development, I started working on RSSParser, a library for parsing RSS feeds on Android. Nowadays, out of my passion for Kotlin Multiplatform, I decided to make RSSParser Multiplatform&amp;hellip; How hard can it be? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this talk, I will share the journey of expanding an Android library into the iOS and JVM world. We will cover the challenges faced during the process, including how to handle platform-specific dependencies, code organization, and testing strategies. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; By the end of this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better understanding of the benefits and challenges of creating a Kotlin Multiplatform library, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools you need to conquer the Multiplatform world!</description>

      <title>FeedFlow</title>

      <description>FeedFlow is a minimalistic and opinionated RSS Reader that&amp;rsquo;s available on Android, iOS, and macOS.
The majority of websites with an RSS feed don&amp;rsquo;t share the article&amp;rsquo;s content because they want you to go on their website. For this reason, FeedFlow always opens the original website, but the browser can be chosen (on mobile). For example, an article can be opened on DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus with all the trackers disabled and then just kill all the navigation data.</description>

      <description>After months of work, I can finally announce the release of FeedFlow, a minimalistic and opinionated RSS Reader that I&amp;rsquo;ve built for myself and that&amp;rsquo;s now available on Android, iOS, and macOS.
Motivation I&amp;rsquo;ve started (again) to stay up to date by building my own feed instead of relying on feeds ordered and decided by someone else. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely satisfied with the readers already out there (&amp;ldquo;I can build a better one&amp;quot;™️).</description>

      <title>Migrating to Jetpack Compose: a step by step journey</title>

      <description>Some time ago, I decided to migrate Secure QR Reader to Jetpack Compose (in the rest of the article, I will call it Compose, for brevity). QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader that I developed some years ago after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require sneaky, strange, and useless permissions.
The app was basic and fully working with the old View system, but I wanted to move to Compose to experience the entire migration process.</description>

      <title>Organize your Views: SwiftUI edition</title>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2023/organize-view-swiftui-edition/</guid>
      <description>One of the pros of SwiftUI, and generally of declarative UI frameworks, is the capability of defining the UI with the same programming language the application uses.
With SwiftUI, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from somewhere else, resulting in a decrease of context switching between two different environments (Storyboards and Swift code, for example)
But “with great power comes great responsibility”, and a codebase can quickly become a nightmare without some structure and organization.</description>

      <title>How to create a parameterized base test class in Kotlin</title>

      <description>One exciting feature of JUnit 4 (and 5 as well, but this post will be focused on JUnit 4) is the possibility of running the same test with different input arguments.
That is made possible by a custom test runner called Parameterized, which will inject the provided arguments in the constructor of the test class. Instead, the different arguments must be defined in the companion object of the test class.</description>

This project soon became a personal playground for a Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app and in a previous article, I journaled all the steps that lead me to a satisfying (at least for that time) shared app architecture.

      <description>QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader designed and developed with a focus on privacy.
I decided to develop it after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents.
The app is very simple (the aim is to scan a code and open the link, only this!) and it does not require sneaky, strange and useless permissions just for the sake of stealing your data. There aren&amp;rsquo;t ads, trackers of any sort and what do you scan remains on your phone.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, the mobile world has started to see larger adoption of the declarative style to build UI as opposed to the (not so) old imperative style. This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, we will explore the declarative style of building UI compared with the imperative one. We will try to enter in this mindset by finding the differences and by looking at some examples of these patterns.</description>

When I tried to run the app on the iOS simulator on Xcode, the build failed with a very strange error: &amp;ldquo;The operation couldn&amp;rsquo;t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime&amp;rdquo;.
This was a very strange issue because the JDK is installed and everything is working on the command line and Android Studio/IntelliJ.</description>

We constantly read of new companies and teams that are trying KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: it safe to do so? Why picking KMP over any another cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll answer to these questions, clarifying all the doubts and making you ready to use and love Kotlin Multiplatform.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Kotlin 1.5.30 has been released. One of the features contained in the release is the official support for XCFrameworks on Kotlin Multiplatform.
XCFramework is a binary that can contain multiple platform-specific variants (even for iOS and macOS at the same time). It has been introduced by Apple during the WWDC 2019 as a replacement for FatFrameworks.
Before Kotlin 1.5.30, an XCFramework could be created only by running the xcrun command that will pack the frameworks for every different required platform into an XCFramework.</description>

      <description>When you start integrating Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) in an existing project you most likely don’t have a mono-repo structure (and making a refactor to achieve this kind of architecture will not be easy). An example of architecture is the following, with a repository for every platform.
To understand how to integrate KMP into existing code, give a look at my previous article: “Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project”</description>

      <description>Gitlab CI/CD offers the possibility to create a pipeline, which runs when something changes in the repository. A pipeline consists of one or more stages that run in order and in these stages, for example, it is possible to build the project, run the tests, create the artifacts, etc. For more information about Gitlab CI/CD, I suggest you look over the documentation.
These out-of-the-box solutions really simplify the work to be done to have a CI up and running.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, the mobile world has started to see larger adoption of the declarative style to build UI as opposed to the (not so) old imperative style. This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, we will explore the declarative style of building UI compared with the imperative one. We will try to enter in this mindset by finding the differences and by looking at some examples of these patterns.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working remotely for a while and during these years I kept improving my work setup. During the last year, I’ve also increased the overall video and audio quality and now I’m pretty confident I’ve ended up with something worth sharing.
A little note before moving on. Some gears I will share are cheap and others are expensive but I think that every product is one of the best that can be found in its price range.</description>

      <title>Introducing KMP FatFramework Cocoa, a Gradle plugin for iOS FatFramework</title>

      <description>Today I want to share KMP FatFramework Cocoa, a Gradle plugin for Kotlin Multiplatform projects that generate a FatFramework for iOS targets and manages the publishing process in a CocoaPod Repository.
The plugin is born from a set of unbundled Gradle tasks that I wrote to manage the building and the publishing process of Kotlin Multiplatform libraries for iOS that we use at Uniwhere and Revelop. The libraries are published in a FatFramework that contains the code for every required architecture (real devices use the Arm64 architecture, while the simulator uses the host computer architecture which in most of the cases is X64).</description>

      <description>After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. That’s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).
This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article).
When starting a new blank KMP project it is easier to have a mono-repo structure like this:</description>

      <description>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.
Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter
https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/
So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.
In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</description>

      <description>It’s been a few years since I started writing this blog, and I quite like sharing my thoughts and experiences. After a short while spent on Medium, I decided I wanted to be the sole owner of my content, so I started experimenting with different solutions and ideas. After I finally landed on the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; tech architecture (I know, I’m lying. There’s no perfect solution and Future Me will most likely refactor and (over)re-engineer the current solution), I started to seek the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; writing setup.</description>

      <description>Kotlin Multiplatform is an alpha feature that you can use to share code between different platforms. Even if it is in alpha stage, it is already possible to start using it in production applications.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, I will share the discussion that led us to Kotlin Multiplatform, and the following processes we put in place to start using it in production for an Android, iOS, and backend project. I will show you what parts of the code you can (gradually) start to share and how to integrate with existing standalone projects.</description>

      <description>If you are starting a project with Kotlin Multiplatform and you want to share the network layer, the best way to go is definitely with Ktor. But if you don’t want to share the entire network layer but maybe only the DTOs? There could be many reasons for wanting this. Maybe you are starting to integrate Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) into an existing project and the work for sharing the entire network layer is simply too much.</description>

      <description>Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day, even if it&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha. We constantly read of new companies and teams that are trying KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: it safe to do so? Why picking KMP over any another cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll answer to these questions, clarifying all the doubts and making you ready to use and love Kotlin Multiplatform.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to work on (yet another) side project: Money Flow. As the name suggests, this is an application to help me track all the expenses and incomes. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought and designed it almost a year ago but only now I&amp;rsquo;ve found the time to start writing actual code.
A first design iteration, that will change a bit
I’ve decided to make this project a personal playground for a Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app.</description>

So I opened the Play Store and I started to search an easy to use application, without lot&amp;rsquo;s of noise (oh, I mean intrusive ads..) and without ulterior motives. Well, I wandered around the Play Store for an hour without finding an answer.
Some apps will require all the imaginable permission only to scan a QR code.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth and last part of this article series about React Native and Flutter.
In the first episode, we have introduced the two frameworks with some history and with a comparison between the languages that they use.
In the second episode, we have talked about User Interfaces and how to build them.
In the third episode, we went deeper under the hood to understand how things work.
And now it&amp;rsquo;s time to wrap things up by trying to understand how to choose the right framework for you.</description>

But I will not go deeper with lot&amp;rsquo;s of details and implementation things, because I want to make you understand how the thing works at a high level.</description>

      <description>These days you have certainly heard about cross-platform mobile development, in particular about the &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; React Native and the &amp;ldquo;freshman&amp;rdquo; Flutter.
Today, I want to start a series of articles to understand the two frameworks. In particular, I want to describe their differences, their weaknesses, their strength&amp;hellip; so, all you need to know to help your choice.
In this article, I want to introduce the two frameworks with a historical overview and an analysis of the languages that they use.</description>

      <description>Today I want to share my setup of note-taking that I use during conferences.
Unfortunately, I’m not the guy able to take the beautiful, colorful sketchnotes that you can see on Twitter. That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc.</description>

I suggested you follow this guide written by Márton Braun.

With Flutter is super easy to implement like shown in the official documentation. However, for me, the tricky part is to combine it with swipeable tabs so, in this article, I’ll explain all the steps that I’ve followed to obtain it.

Some weeks ago I released a new version of the RSS Parser Library and I talked about the update in a blog post.
RSS Parser 2.0: bye bye Async Task, welcome Coroutines This update brought a huge change in the infrastructure of the library. SPOILER: Kotlin and coroutines. Today, in this post I want to talk about the transition process and all the decisions that I have made to develop this new version.</description>

      <description>Finally, I found some time to sit down and work on my library RSS Parser. Before starting to describe all the cool stuff that I’ve introduced with this update, I want to thank you all for the support. In fact this year, the library exceeded 100 stars on Github, that seems a little goal but it means a lot to me.
I wrote this library back in 2016 and now in 2018, the code was “ugly” compared to all the coolest stuff provided by Kotlin.</description>

      <description>This Android application has been developed during an University Class and the aim was to provide a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; to the Cyber Robot, a cheap sensorless toy robot sell by Clementoni. More information about the robot can be found on the official website. More specifically, the aim was to reverse-engineer the communication protocol of the robot via the Bluetooth HCI snoop log and then build an app that guides it to reach a target object that is framed by the phone’s camera.</description>

In all the following commands I&amp;rsquo;ve omitted &amp;ldquo;sudo&amp;rdquo;. Please use it when it is necessary.
Before starting make you sure that all the packages are updated.
