But if you don’t want to share the entire network layer but maybe only the DTOs? There could be many reasons for wanting this. Maybe you are starting to integrate Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) into an existing project and the work for sharing the entire network layer is simply too much....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2020-12-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>10 December 2020</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2020/kmm-shared-app-architecture/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Choosing the right architecture for a [new] Kotlin Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI app</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Recently, I’ve started to work on (yet another) side project: Money Flow.

A first design iteration, that will change a bit

Today, I want to share my thoughts and considerations about them and why/when you should use cross-platform. I hope that these thoughts will be helpful to anyone that is in the process of choosing the right solution for their product.

Friends Tournament is a simple application that will help you to manage and organize tournaments with your friends.

Unfortunately, I’m not the guy able to take the beautiful, colorful sketchnotes that you can see on Twitter. That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic.
