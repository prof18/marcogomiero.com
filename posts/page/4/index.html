After a short while spent on Medium, I decided I wanted to be the sole owner of my content, so I started experimenting with different solutions and ideas. After I finally landed on the “perfect” tech architecture (I know, I’m lying. There’s no perfect solution and Future Me will most likely refactor and (over)re-engineer the current solution), I started to seek the “perfect” writing setup.

But if you don’t want to share the entire network layer but maybe only the DTOs? There could be many reasons for wanting this. Maybe you are starting to integrate Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) into an existing project and the work for sharing the entire network layer is simply too much.

Today, I want to share my thoughts and considerations about them and why/when you should use cross-platform. I hope that these thoughts will be helpful to anyone that is in the process of choosing the right solution for their product.

Well, I wandered around the Play Store for an hour without finding an answer.
Some apps will require all the imaginable permission only to scan a QR code. Come on, why do you need my contacts and my location for the scanning? 🤬

Friends Tournament is a simple application that will help you to manage and organize tournaments with your friends. You can use it to generate videogames tournament, sports tournament, board games tournament, whatever type of tournament do you want. All you need to do is to provide the number of players, the number of matches and the numbers of player that can play at the same time. That’s all! Friends Tournament will then generate the matches and the rounds for you. You can then keep the score of each player and a leaderboard will be generated automatically.

How to build UIs? How do things work under the hood? These are the types of questions that I’ve answered during the series of articles about Flutter and React Native.
Some time ago I started learning Flutter for fun reasons and at the same time, I (had to) started learning React Native for work reasons. While learning and using them, I started to see some differences and some common concepts between them. So I decided to share my findings with a talk in both local meetups and international conferences (If you are curious there is a talk section in the website). From this talk, I’ve extracted a series of articles and here we are!

In the first episode, we have introduced the two frameworks with some history and with a comparison between the languages that they use.
In the second episode, we have talked about User Interfaces and how to build them.
In the third episode, we went deeper under the hood to understand how things work.
And now it’s time to wrap things up by trying to understand how to choose the right framework for you.

Flutter or React Native, a cross-platform dilemma - Introduction - (Part 1)
In this article, I will explain how to build user interfaces in React Native and Flutter. Disclaimer: This article will not cover all the deep aspects of the two frameworks, but I want to give you an overview to better understand the differences. For much deeper details, I suggest you look at the official documentation (React Native - Flutter)

Today, I want to start a series of articles to understand the two frameworks. In particular, I want to describe their differences, their weaknesses, their strength… so, all you need to know to help your choice.
In this article, I want to introduce the two frameworks with a historical overview and an analysis of the languages that they use. Next, in the following articles, I will move the focus on how to build User Interfaces with these two frameworks and how they work internally.

Unfortunately, I’m not the guy able to take the beautiful, colorful sketchnotes that you can see on Twitter. That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc.
