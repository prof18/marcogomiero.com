Today, I want to share my thoughts and considerations about them and why/when you should use cross-platform. I hope that these thoughts will be helpful to anyone that is in the process of choosing the right solution for their product.

So I opened the Play Store and I started to search an easy to use application, without lot’s of noise (oh, I mean intrusive ads..) and without ulterior motives. Well, I wandered around the Play Store for an hour without finding an answer.
Some apps will require all the imaginable permission only to scan a QR code....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2020-07-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>28 July 2020</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2020/friends-tournament-release/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Friends Tournament - Tournament creation and management made easy</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Today I want to share Friends Tournament, a side project that I have been working on for the past year during my spare time.
Friends Tournament is a simple application that will help you to manage and organize tournaments with your friends.

All you need to do is to provide the number of players, the number of matches and the numbers of player that can play at the same time....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2020-06-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>12 June 2020</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2020/rn-flutter-dilemma-series/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Flutter or React Native, a cross-platform dilemma - Serie wrap-up</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Which framework should I use?

Unfortunately, I’m not the guy able to take the beautiful, colorful sketchnotes that you can see on Twitter. That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2019-07-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>6 July 2019</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2019/publish-librery-android/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>How to publish and distribute your Android library</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Update - February 2021 As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.

So, this tutorial is no longer recommended because it explains how to publish an Android library to JCenter.
I suggested you follow this guide written by Márton Braun.
