With Flutter is super easy to implement like shown in the official documentation. However, for me, the tricky part is to combine it with swipeable tabs so, in this article, I’ll explain all the steps that I’ve followed to obtain it.
Here’s a spoiler of the final result:...</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2019-03-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>20 March 2019</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2019/asynctask-to-coroutines/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>A journey from Async Task to Kotlin Coroutines</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Photo by felipe lopez on Unsplash
Some weeks ago I released a new version of the RSS Parser Library and I talked about the update in a blog post.
RSS Parser 2.0: bye bye Async Task, welcome Coroutines This update brought a huge change in the infrastructure of the library. SPOILER: Kotlin and coroutines. Today, in this post I want to talk about the transition process and all the decisions that I have made to develop this new version....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2019-01-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>14 January 2019</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2018/bye-async-task/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>RSS Parser 2.0: bye bye Async Task, welcome Coroutines</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Finally, I found some time to sit down and work on my library RSS Parser. Before starting to describe all the cool stuff that I’ve introduced with this update, I want to thank you all for the support. In fact this year, the library exceeded 100 stars on Github, that seems a little goal but it means a lot to me.
I wrote this library back in 2016 and now in 2018, the code was “ugly” compared to all the coolest stuff provided by Kotlin....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2018-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>22 December 2018</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2018/image-update-rss-lib/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>New update for RSS Parser: featured image</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Today I’ve released a new version of the Android library RSS-Parser
