Before starting to describe all the cool stuff that I’ve introduced with this update, I want to thank you all for the support. In fact this year, the library exceeded 100 stars on Github, that seems a little goal but it means a lot to me.
I wrote this library back in 2016 and now in 2018, the code was “ugly” compared to all the coolest stuff provided by Kotlin....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta>&lt;span title='2018-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>22 December 2018&lt;/span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2018/image-update-rss-lib/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>New update for RSS Parser: featured image</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Today I’ve released a new version of the Android library RSS-Parser
This library allows you to easily download an (or multiple) RSS Feed in order to display it in your application. If you don’t know RSS-Parser, you can give a look to the blog post dedicated to it. In that post I’ll give also some tip about the library usage.
Thanks to the issues and the suggestions provided by the community, I’ve improved the parsing of the feature image of the article....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta>&lt;span title='2018-05-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>6 May 2018&lt;/span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2018/wordpress-arch/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>How to install Wordpress on Arch Linux</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Every time I’ve tried to install Wordpress on Arch Linux it was a tragedy. Sometimes a configuration was missing, sometimes stuff not well known was broken and I never found an updated and complete guide. So here you are!
In all the following commands I’ve omitted “sudo”. Please use it when it is necessary.
Before starting make you sure that all the packages are updated.

Today I want to talk about RSS-Parser, another library that I wrote.

YoutubeParser is the first Android library that I ever wrote. With this library it is possible to get information of videos from Youtube channels. These information are:

On 17th December 2016 I’ve attended my first talk as speaker (GDG Venezia Tech Talks 17/12/16). Despite the firsts scared thoughts this was an amazing experience! In fact I’ve replicated that, but I’ll talk about it with a future post (that won’t be published the next year - I promise :) ). The topic of the talk was a hot one: backup and restore on Android Application....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta>&lt;span title='2017-04-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>5 April 2017&lt;/span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2017/hello-world/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Hello World!</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Hello World!
