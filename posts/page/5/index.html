Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter
https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/
So, this tutorial is no longer recommended because it explains how to publish an Android library to JCenter.
I suggested you follow this guide written by Márton Braun.
Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021 https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/
If you have already published a library on JCenter and you want to migrate the old artifacts to MavenCentral, you can follow the guide that I’ve written:

With Flutter is super easy to implement like shown in the official documentation. However, for me, the tricky part is to combine it with swipeable tabs so, in this article, I’ll explain all the steps that I’ve followed to obtain it.

Some weeks ago I released a new version of the RSS Parser Library and I talked about the update in a blog post.
RSS Parser 2.0: bye bye Async Task, welcome Coroutines This update brought a huge change in the infrastructure of the library. SPOILER: Kotlin and coroutines. Today, in this post I want to talk about the transition process and all the decisions that I have made to develop this new version. In this way, I hope to inspire you to leave the Async Task and get into the coroutines world.

Before starting to describe all the cool stuff that I’ve introduced with this update, I want to thank you all for the support. In fact this year, the library exceeded 100 stars on Github, that seems a little goal but it means a lot to me.
I wrote this library back in 2016 and now in 2018, the code was “ugly” compared to all the coolest stuff provided by Kotlin.

This library allows you to easily download an (or multiple) RSS Feed in order to display it in your application. If you don’t know RSS-Parser, you can give a look to the blog post dedicated to it. In that post I’ll give also some tip about the library usage.
Thanks to the issues and the suggestions provided by the community, I’ve improved the parsing of the feature image of the article. Now the parser, first search a specific image content, next if nothing is found it search inside the description and next inside the content of ther article. In this way there are three different sources for the image, in order to minimize the absense.

In all the following commands I’ve omitted “sudo”. Please use it when it is necessary.
Before starting make you sure that all the packages are updated.
pacman -Syu Install Apache First of all, you need to install and configure Apache, the web server.

Today I want to talk about RSS-Parser, another library that I wrote.

For people who don’t know what I’m talking about, don’t worry now I’m going to explain all.
YoutubeParser is the first Android library that I ever wrote. With this library it is possible to get information of videos from Youtube channels. These information are:
Title Link Thumbnail, with three different image size. After a year I’ve released this new big update, named 2.0, that introduces a bunch of new things. First of all, now it is possible to load more than 50 videos from the same channel. 50 is the maximum number of videos that can be retrieved with a single request.

On 17th December 2016 I’ve attended my first talk as speaker (GDG Venezia Tech Talks 17/12/16). Despite the firsts scared thoughts this was an amazing experience! In fact I’ve replicated that, but I’ll talk about it with a future post (that won’t be published the next year - I promise :) ). The topic of the talk was a hot one: backup and restore on Android Application. But today I wanna only share the video and the slide of the talk (that is in Italian).
