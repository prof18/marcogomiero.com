One of the features contained in the release is the official support for XCFrameworks on Kotlin Multiplatform.
XCFramework is a binary that can contain multiple platform-specific variants (even for iOS and macOS at the same time). It has been introduced by Apple during the WWDC 2019 as a replacement for FatFrameworks.
Before Kotlin 1.5.30, an XCFramework could be created only by running the xcrun command that will pack the frameworks for every different required platform into an XCFramework....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2021-08-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>30 August 2021</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2021/build-xcframework-kmp/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>How to build an XCFramework on Kotlin Multiplatform</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>When you start integrating Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) in an existing project you most likely don’t have a mono-repo structure (and making a refactor to achieve this kind of architecture will not be easy). An example of architecture is the following, with a repository for every platform.

A pipeline consists of one or more stages that run in order and in these stages, for example, it is possible to build the project, run the tests, create the artifacts, etc. For more information about Gitlab CI/CD, I suggest you look over the documentation.
These out-of-the-box solutions really simplify the work to be done to have a CI up and running....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2021-06-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>28 June 2021</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2021/ktor-logging-on-disk/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>How to persist Ktor logs</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>SERIES: Building a backend with Ktor

During the last year, I’ve also increased the overall video and audio quality and now I’m pretty confident I’ve ended up with something worth sharing.

The plugin is born from a set of unbundled Gradle tasks that I wrote to manage the building and the publishing process of Kotlin Multiplatform libraries for iOS that we use at Uniwhere and Revelop. The libraries are published in a FatFramework that contains the code for every required architecture (real devices use the Arm64 architecture, while the simulator uses the host computer architecture which in most of the cases is X64)....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2021-03-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>2 March 2021</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2021/kmp-existing-project/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. That’s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).
This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article).
When starting a new blank KMP project it is easier to have a mono-repo structure like this:...</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2021-02-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>25 February 2021</span></div></section></a><div class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"><a href=/posts/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>← Prev</span></a></span>
