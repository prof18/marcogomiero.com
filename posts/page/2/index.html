@ObjCName: allows to customize the name that will be used in Swift or Objective-C @HiddenFromObjC: allows hiding a Kotlin declaration from Objective-C (and Swift). @ShouldRefineInSwift: it marks a Kotlin declaration as swift_private in the Objective-C API, allowing to replace it with a wrapper written in Swift. You can see the release announcement for more details about the interoperability improvements introduced with Kotlin 1.8.

Motivation I’ve started (again) to stay up to date by building my own feed instead of relying on feeds ordered and decided by someone else. But I wasn’t completely satisfied with the readers already out there (“I can build a better one”™️). What I want for an RSS reader is the possibility of easily going through my feed and being able to open the article that I want to read on the respective website. Yes, you read it right.

QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader that I developed some years ago after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents that doesn’t require sneaky, strange, and useless permissions.
The app was basic and fully working with the old View system, but I wanted to move to Compose to experience the entire migration process.

With SwiftUI, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from somewhere else, resulting in a decrease of context switching between two different environments (Storyboards and Swift code, for example)
But “with great power comes great responsibility”, and a codebase can quickly become a nightmare without some structure and organization. Long files, large structs, and stateful UI components that hinder reusability are examples that can lead to a messed codebase.

With Compose, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from XML (e.g. with the [in]famous findViewById), resulting in less context switching between two different environments (XML and Kotlin code).

That is made possible by a custom test runner called Parameterized, which will inject the provided arguments in the constructor of the test class. Instead, the different arguments must be defined in the companion object of the test class.
