With Compose, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from XML (e.g. with the [in]famous findViewById), resulting in less context switching between two different environments (XML and Kotlin code)....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2023-03-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>15 March 2023</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2023/parameterized-kotlin-base-test/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>How to create a parameterized base test class in Kotlin</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>One exciting feature of JUnit 4 (and 5 as well, but this post will be focused on JUnit 4) is the possibility of running the same test with different input arguments.
That is made possible by a custom test runner called Parameterized, which will inject the provided arguments in the constructor of the test class.

This project soon became a personal playground for a Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app and in a previous article, I journaled all the steps that lead me to a satisfying (at least for that time) shared app architecture.

One of the features contained in the release is the official support for XCFrameworks on Kotlin Multiplatform.
XCFramework is a binary that can contain multiple platform-specific variants (even for iOS and macOS at the same time). It has been introduced by Apple during the WWDC 2019 as a replacement for FatFrameworks.
Before Kotlin 1.5.30, an XCFramework could be created only by running the xcrun command that will pack the frameworks for every different required platform into an XCFramework....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2021-08-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>30 August 2021</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2021/build-xcframework-kmp/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>How to build an XCFramework on Kotlin Multiplatform</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>When you start integrating Kotlin Multiplatform (I’ll call it KMP in the rest of the article) in an existing project you most likely don’t have a mono-repo structure (and making a refactor to achieve this kind of architecture will not be easy). An example of architecture is the following, with a repository for every platform.

A pipeline consists of one or more stages that run in order and in these stages, for example, it is possible to build the project, run the tests, create the artifacts, etc. For more information about Gitlab CI/CD, I suggest you look over the documentation.
