My typical macOS setup is one Desktop/Workspace per project, with my IDE and a terminal window. I prefer using a standalone terminal over the one built into the IDE because TUIs, especially those from AI agents, tend to perform better there: no scrolling jank, no weird jumps, and a generally smoother experience. And also I prefer to have a full big window dedicated to the terminal with more stuff to read rather than a small window in the IDE.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m lazy. Every time I switch to a different project, I need to open a new terminal window and navigate to the right path.</p><p>So my lazy-driven-development™ skills kicked in and <a href=https://shellporter.com><strong>Shellporter</strong></a> was born: a macOS menu bar utility that opens a terminal in the project directory of the active IDE window, with a single global hotkey press or by clicking a button in the menu bar.</p><figure><a href=/img/shellporter/menu-bar.png><img src=/img/shellporter/menu-bar.png></a></figure><span class=raw-html><video controls style=max-width:100%;height:auto>
<source src=/img/shellporter/shellporter.mp4 type=video/mp4></video></span><h2 id=how-it-works>How it works</h2><p>When you press <code>Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+T</code>, Shellporter:</p><ol><li>Identifies the frontmost IDE and its window</li><li>Reads the window title and document attributes via the macOS Accessibility API</li><li>Runs a chain of resolution strategies tailored to each IDE family</li><li>Opens the configured terminal at that directory</li></ol><p>If everything fails, a manual folder picker shows up as a last resort.</p><p>It supports (at the time of writing of this article) <strong>JetBrains IDEs, Android Studio, VS Code, Cursor, Antigravity, and Xcode</strong>. On the terminal side: <strong>Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty</strong>, and a custom command option for anything else. This cover the current set of IDEs and terminals that I use daily, but if you need support for a different IDE or terminal, contributions are welcome. Feel free to <a href=https://github.com/prof18/shellporter/pulls>open a PR</a> or <a href=https://github.com/prof18/shellporter/issues>an issue</a>.</p><p>Different IDEs expose project information in very different ways, so a &ldquo;catch them all"™ approach doesn&rsquo;t work. Shellporter uses a chain of resolution strategies: window title parsing, Accessibility API document attributes, IDE metadata files (<code>recentProjects.xml</code> for JetBrains, <code>storage.json</code> for VS Code) and the chain order changes depending on the IDE family, prioritizing the most reliable source for each one.</p><p>A resolution cache sits at the end of the chain as a fallback. The Accessibility API can return <code>nil</code> during app transitions, window switches, or full-screen animations, so the cache ensures that a previously resolved path is still available when the live strategies temporarily fail.</p><h2 id=how-its-built>How it&rsquo;s built</h2><h3 id=no-xcode>No Xcode</h3><p>This project was the perfect occasion for experiment and trying different ways of working.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go with a no Xcode approach, not only for writing code (something I&rsquo;ve been doing already for a while for <a href=https://www.feedflow.dev/>FeedFlow</a> and <a href=https://www.readerflow.app/>ReaderFlow</a>) but also for packaging and releasing.</p><p>The inspiration came from this post by <a href=https://x.com/Dimillian>Thomas Ricouard</a> about <a href=https://x.com/steipete>Peter Steinberger</a>&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/>CodexBar</a> repo</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>I like how <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@steipete</a> completely shortcut Xcode for building, packaging, and releasing macOS apps.<br>Next time I make a pure macOS app I'll take CodexBar repo as an example. Full of ready to use useful scripts. <a href=https://t.co/NzVd1SMUQJ>pic.twitter.com/NzVd1SMUQJ</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Ricouard (@Dimillian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/2008857676625985939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>I&rsquo;ve pulled <a href=https://github.com/Dimillian/Skills/tree/main/macos-spm-app-packaging>the skill</a> that Thomas created from CodexBar, and started exploring how CodexBar is done. The end result is amazing: everything is handled by <a href=https://github.com/prof18/Shellporter/tree/main/Scripts>a bunch of scripts</a> for running the app, packaging, releasing, etc, that an agent can easily pick.</p><h3 id=agentic-development>Agentic development</h3><p>Another experiment occasion was to fully use the new Codex app, since I&rsquo;ve always used Claude Code and Codex from the CLI (easy guess given what I&rsquo;m building here).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started with an empty folder, and I&rsquo;ve started chatting with Codex (GPT-5.3-Codex High) telling what I wanted to build and how I wanted it (a SwiftPM-only macOS).
Just a simple chat without any overcomplicated flows and multiagents preplanning etc. This is my usually way of working: keep it simple and &ldquo;YOLO&rdquo; it by talking with the agent.</p><p>After answering a bunch of questions and some discussion, I&rsquo;ve asked to write down the implementation plan, just to have it written in case I want to change chat and the development started. The initial implementation was pretty good and it took me only a bunch of back and forth to refine the functionalities. Some of the follow-ups were to simplify the code and make it simpler because at the beginning it was a bit overengineered.</p><p>To review, refine and refactor I&rsquo;ve decided to use Claude Code and Opus 4.6, just to have another pair of eyes. And this worked nicely: Claude Code found things that Codex didn&rsquo;t and viceversa. I like using both.</p><h2 id=from-idea-to-production>From idea to production</h2><p>I&rsquo;m writing this announcement post on a Saturday morning and I&rsquo;ve started the development on Monday evening. So the entire process from idea to production took <strong>less than a week</strong> which is quite astonishing.</p><p>As always, the blocker in this case is the publishing part. After 2 evenings I had the app working and I&rsquo;ve started dogfooding it already with my workflow. I&rsquo;ve spent the remaining 3 evenings to polish the code, prepare the release, documentations, announcements, websites, etc etc.</p><blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve unlocked and sped up the development part, but we still need to speed up the publishing part. Even with publishing as the bottleneck, now it&rsquo;s the best time to build and put your idea out.</p></blockquote><h2 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping up</h2><p>I built Shellporter for my specific workflow, but I decided to publish it because other folks might be in the same situation: going throught multiple projects with a standalone terminal and getting annoyed by the constant <code>cd</code>-ing around.</p><p>Shellporter is <a href=https://github.com/prof18/shellporter>open source on GitHub</a>. You can find more details and download it from the <a href=https://shellporter.com>website</a> or directly from the <a href=https://github.com/prof18/shellporter/releases>GitHub releases page</a>. It requires macOS 14+ and the Accessibility permission.</p><p>The current set of supported IDEs and terminals covers what I use daily, but if you need support for a different IDE or terminal, contributions are welcome; feel free to <a href=https://github.com/prof18/shellporter/pulls>open a PR</a> or <a href=https://github.com/prof18/shellporter/issues>an issue</a>. Same goes for suggestions or ideas: I&rsquo;m open to feedback, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to open an issue.</p></section><div class=article-footer><div class=body>To stay up to date with my writing and my projects, follow me on <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/marcogomiero.com target=_blank>Bluesky</a>, <a href=https://androiddev.social/@marcogom target=_blank>Mastodon</a> or <a href=https://twitter.com/marcoGomier target=_blank>Twitter</a>.
