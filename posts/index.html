@ObjCName: allows to customize the name that will be used in Swift or Objective-C @HiddenFromObjC: allows hiding a Kotlin declaration from Objective-C (and Swift). @ShouldRefineInSwift: it marks a Kotlin declaration as swift_private in the Objective-C API, allowing to replace it with a wrapper written in Swift.

QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader that I developed some years ago after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents that doesn’t require sneaky, strange, and useless permissions.
The app was basic and fully working with the old View system, but I wanted to move to Compose to experience the entire migration process....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2023-05-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>12 May 2023</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2023/organize-view-swiftui-edition/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Organize your Views: SwiftUI edition</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>One of the pros of SwiftUI, and generally of declarative UI frameworks, is the capability of defining the UI with the same programming language the application uses.
With SwiftUI, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from somewhere else, resulting in a decrease of context switching between two different environments (Storyboards and Swift code, for example)

That is made possible by a custom test runner called Parameterized, which will inject the provided arguments in the constructor of the test class.
