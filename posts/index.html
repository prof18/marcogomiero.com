(Note: the plugin is currently in maintenance mode; using KMMBridge might be a better option.)
After building the Framework, the plugin handles the publishing process by interacting with a Git-based CocoaPods repository. It copies the Framework into the repository, updates the podspec file with the latest version, commits the changes, and pushes them....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2025-05-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>13 May 2025</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2025/bug-hunting-story/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>The curious case of a weird VerifyError crash</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>This post can be considered as a journal entry. I had to clear my thoughts and vent off through writing after spending time debugging this issue. Maybe it will be helpful for future references or an example of the process to follow in such cases.
The other day I was doing the usual dependency update routine of FeedFlow when I discovered a runtime crash that happened in the release version (so with R8 enabled) after updating the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP, in the rest of the article) to version 8....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2025-04-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>6 April 2025</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2025/android-lib-to-kmp/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>From an Android to a Kotlin Multiplatform library</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>As Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) continues to gain traction, more Android libraries are transitioning to support multiple platforms. However, this transition doesn’t always come for free; depending on the project, there could be different challenges.
Recently, I migrated an existing Android library (RSS-Parser, a library to parse RSS feeds). In this article, I will share my experience, cover all the challenges I faced during this journey, and describe the solutions I implemented to overcome them, from preserving git history to handling platform-specific dependencies and testing across different platforms....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2025-03-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>16 March 2025</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2025/rant-transitive-deps/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Watch out for transitive dependencies: an “obvious” rant</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>This article is just a short “rant” and a “therapy session” to remind and warn my future self.
I was recently debugging a weird crash affecting some users. The issue was related to navigation, fragments, and backstacks.
After weeks spent trying to reproduce it, reading online reports, and cross-referencing previous libraries and SDK updates, I finally had an illuminating moment after reading about a similar behavior in the Google Issue Tracker....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2025-01-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>14 January 2025</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2025/ublock-maven/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Don’t let Maven block you!</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>As developers, we’ve all encountered build failures in CI (or on our local machines) due to Maven repository issues preventing dependency downloads.
