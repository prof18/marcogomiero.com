Motivation I’ve started (again) to stay up to date by building my own feed instead of relying on feeds ordered and decided by someone else. But I wasn’t completely satisfied with the readers already out there (“I can build a better one"™️)....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2023-07-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>31 July 2023</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2023/migration-to-compose/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Migrating to Jetpack Compose: a step by step journey</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>Some time ago, I decided to migrate Secure QR Reader to Jetpack Compose (in the rest of the article, I will call it Compose, for brevity). QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader that I developed some years ago after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents that doesn’t require sneaky, strange, and useless permissions.
The app was basic and fully working with the old View system, but I wanted to move to Compose to experience the entire migration process....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2023-05-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>12 May 2023</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2023/organize-view-swiftui-edition/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Organize your Views: SwiftUI edition</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>One of the pros of SwiftUI, and generally of declarative UI frameworks, is the capability of defining the UI with the same programming language the application uses.
With SwiftUI, it is not necessary anymore to bridge the UI definitions from somewhere else, resulting in a decrease of context switching between two different environments (Storyboards and Swift code, for example)
But “with great power comes great responsibility”, and a codebase can quickly become a nightmare without some structure and organization....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2023-03-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>23 March 2023</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2023/organize-view-compose-edition/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Organize your Views: Jetpack Compose edition</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>One of the pros of Jetpack Compose (in the rest of the article, I will just call it Compose, for brevity), and generally of declarative UI frameworks, is the capability of defining the UI with the same programming language the rest of the application uses.

That is made possible by a custom test runner called Parameterized, which will inject the provided arguments in the constructor of the test class. Instead, the different arguments must be defined in the companion object of the test class....</p></div><div class=post-list-entry-meta><span title='2023-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>31 January 2023</span></div></section></a><a href=/posts/2022/improved-kmm-shared-app-arch/><section class=post-list-entry><h2 class=postlist-entry-title>Improving shared architecture for a Kotlin Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI app</h2><div class=post-list-entry-content><p>A couple of years ago I started working on a pet project to manage personal finances, named MoneyFlow.
This project soon became a personal playground for a Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app and in a previous article, I journaled all the steps that lead me to a satisfying (at least for that time) shared app architecture.
