My typical macOS setup is one Desktop/Workspace per project, with my IDE and a terminal window. I prefer using a standalone terminal over the one built into the IDE because TUIs, especially those from AI agents, tend to perform better there: no scrolling jank, no weird jumps, and a generally smoother experience. And also I prefer to have a full big window dedicated to the terminal with more stuff to read rather than a small window in the IDE.

I started this project because I had a very specific (and very lazy) problem: I wanted to enable my phone hotspot without taking my phone out of my pocket. I do it often when I’m travelling or working somewhere without stable Wi-Fi, and every time it was the same ritual: unlock phone, quick settings, find the hotspot tile, toggle, put phone away.
At some point, I thought: “This should be a button on my wrist.”

However, things get trickier if platform-specific APIs, like iCloud on macOS, are needed. These APIs are tied to their native platforms and aren’t designed to be easily shared across multiple targets. Integrating such APIs into a Compose Multiplatform (in this article, when I mention Compose Multiplatform, I’m referring to Compose Multiplatform Desktop apps that run on the JVM) project requires some additional setup and “creativity”.

(Note: the plugin is currently in maintenance mode; using KMMBridge might be a better option.)
After building the Framework, the plugin handles the publishing process by interacting with a Git-based CocoaPods repository. It copies the Framework into the repository, updates the podspec file with the latest version, commits the changes, and pushes them.

I had to clear my thoughts and vent off through writing after spending time debugging this issue. Maybe it will be helpful for future references or an example of the process to follow in such cases.
The other day I was doing the usual dependency update routine of FeedFlow when I discovered a runtime crash that happened in the release version (so with R8 enabled) after updating the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP, in the rest of the article) to version 8.7.

However, this transition doesn’t always come for free; depending on the project, there could be different challenges.
Recently, I migrated an existing Android library (RSS-Parser, a library to parse RSS feeds). In this article, I will share my experience, cover all the challenges I faced during this journey, and describe the solutions I implemented to overcome them, from preserving git history to handling platform-specific dependencies and testing across different platforms.

I was recently debugging a weird crash affecting some users. The issue was related to navigation, fragments, and backstacks.
After weeks spent trying to reproduce it, reading online reports, and cross-referencing previous libraries and SDK updates, I finally had an illuminating moment after reading about a similar behavior in the Google Issue Tracker. It made me wonder: Could something have changed in the Android Manifest?
