That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc.</p><p>So, after long and many tests, I found that <a href=https://products.office.com/it-it/onenote/digital-note-taking-app><strong>OneNote by Microsoft</strong></a> is the best solution for me. Of course, I’m open to suggestions; in the future, I want also to try <a href=https://www.notion.so/>Notion</a>.</p><p>Now, let’s give a look to my OneNote setup. In OneNote, you can create <em>notebooks</em>, <em>sections</em>, and <em>pages</em>: the <em>sections</em> are contained in a <em>notebook</em> and the <em>pages</em> are contained in a <em>section</em>.</p><figure><img src=/img/one-note.png alt=image></figure><p>I use <em>sections</em> as collectors for different arguments: so, for example, I have a <em>section</em> that gathers all the conferences, one for the online courses that I follow, one for my side projects and so on and so forth. In the <em>section</em> dedicated to the conferences, I create a <em>page</em> for each conference I attend. Inside this <em>page</em>, I write the title of the talk that I’m attending and I start to take my notes!</p><figure><img src=/img/single-note.png alt=image></figure><p>I take my notes using the <strong>desktop or the mobile application</strong>, it depends on my mood. Together with notes, I like to add some interesting slides. I know, I can it later on when the speaker uploads them, but I like to have some slide embedded with notes. After the talk or after the conference, I update the “talk section” with the link to the slide and/or the video recording. In this way, I have all the useful information that I want to remember in one place.</p><p>Eventually, from OneNote you can <strong>export the page as PDF</strong> to share with other people. However, I admit that the export function of OneNote is a bit silly. In fact, all the images will be cut in order to fit correctly the A4 page if they are placed in a “border zone”. But for this I have a “hack”: if you export the note as PDF from the mobile application, a single page PDF will be generated. I know, this is not so beautiful but I don’t use very often the export function. This is also the main reason that makes me want to try Notion, as said above.</p><p>So this is my setup. If you have some suggestions, I’m glad to listen to them and I hope that these tips will be helpful!</p></section><div class=article-footer><div class=body>To stay up to date with my writing and my projects, follow me on <a href=https://androiddev.social/@marcogom target=_blank>Mastodon</a> or <a href=https://twitter.com/marcoGomier target=_blank>Twitter</a>.
