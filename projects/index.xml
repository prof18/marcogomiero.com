      <description>FeedFlow is a minimalistic and opinionated RSS Reader that&amp;rsquo;s available on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux.&#xA;The majority of websites with an RSS feed don&amp;rsquo;t share the article&amp;rsquo;s content because they want you to go on their website. For this reason, FeedFlow always opens the original website, but the browser can be chosen (on mobile). For example, an article can be opened on DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus with all the trackers disabled and then just kill all the navigation data.</description>

      <description>QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader designed and developed with a focus on privacy.&#xA;I decided to develop it after a failed search for a simple and secure reader for my parents.&#xA;The app is very simple (the aim is to scan a code and open the link, only this!) and it does not require sneaky, strange and useless permissions just for the sake of stealing your data. There aren&amp;rsquo;t ads, trackers of any sort and what do you scan remains on your phone.</description>
