I know, I'm very very late.


On 17th December 2016 I've attended my first talk as speaker (GDG Venezia Tech Talks 17/12/16).
Despite the firsts scared thoughts this was an amazing experience!
In fact I've replicated that, but I'll talk about it with a future post (that won't be published the next year -
I promise :) ).
<br>
<br>
The topic of the talk was a hot one: backup and restore on Android Application. But
today I wanna only share the video and the slide of the talk (that is in Italian). In the following
article I'll go deep on the argument and I will explain all.
