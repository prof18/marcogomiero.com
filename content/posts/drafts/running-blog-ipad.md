Sort of Scaletta:

1. I have a blog, where I write about stuff. Since 6 months I bought an iPad and one of the reason is to use it as the main blogging machine. I have a 15 inches macbook pro that is too heavier and big for a soft task like blogging. So I wanted a small machine to handle this. I bought a keyboard and its amazing. I think also that with a “limited” machine like an ipad you are more focused to do one stuff at the time. And I’m not <tentato> to open the IDE and do some programming stuff
2. How the blog is structured. It’s Hugo with a custom theme, managed with a github repo and with an action to automate the publishing when something is pushed in master
3. I write stuff using this application and publish throught working copy
4. I have some custom shurtcuts to help me during the composition. One for creating a new article and one for moving a photo from the gallery to the repo and generate the deep link to paste in the article

- Photo of the ipad with keyboard and homepage the website


- iOs shortcut for creating a new article: video + explanation

- iOs shortcut for adding a new image: video + explanation

- github action for publishing

hugo: https://gohugo.io/


base theme. I use a customized version of it: https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/

Application that I use:

Markdown editor. Right now I’m using MWeb https://apps.apple.com/it/app/mweb-powerful-markdown-app/id1183407767?l=en

In the past I’ve used Pretext https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pretext/id1347707000?l=en
But it has an annoying bug. Every time i switch app and return to the editor it scrolls automatically down.

I’d like to try iA Writer https://apps.apple.com/it/app/ia-writer/id775737172?l=en but it is quiet expensive and i don’t know if it worth it without first trying it.

For handling the git reporitory i use Working Copy https://apps.apple.com/it/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807?l=en

It is an amazing client, a bit expensive, but it totally worth it
