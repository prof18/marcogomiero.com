Today I've released a new version of the Android library RSS-Parser

 This library allows you to easily download an (or multiple) RSS Feed in order to display it in your application. If you don't know RSS-Parser, you can give a look to the [blog post](http://www.marcogomiero.com/blog/rss-parser-library/) dedicated to it. In that post I'll give also some tip about the library usage. 


Starting from today you can get also the categories of the article, like shown in the screen below.

Of course the source code of the library is on Github together with a sample application that shows what you can do with the library.


*  [Click here to view the library on Github](https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser) 
*  [Click here to show the code of the sample app](https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser/tree/master/app)  
*  [Click here to download the app.](https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser/blob/master/RSS%20Parser.apk) 

That’s all! Please let me know if you notice any bug or if you have any advice that can improve this library.
