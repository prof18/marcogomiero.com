I’m a software engineer, currently working as Tech Lead at [Uniwhere](https://www.uniwhere.com/it), where I manage the end-to-end development of a platform with half a million users, and I'm in the founding team of [Revelop](https://revelop.app/), a redesign of the personal inbox, backed by former Facebook executives, and being used in the best American schools -- from Harvard to Columbia.

I'm a Google Developer Expert for Kotlin, I love Kotlin and I have experience with native Android and native iOS development, as well as cross-platform development with React Native, Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform.

In my spare time I write and maintain open source code, I share my dev experience by [writing](/posts) on my blog, [speaking](/talks) at confs and [organizing](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-venezia/) events with the Google Developer Group Venezia and I play basketball.
