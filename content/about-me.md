I’m Tech Lead at Uniwhere, where I manage the end-to-end development of a platform with half a million users, and I'm in the founding team of Revelop, a redesign of the personal inbox, backed by former Facebook executives, and being used in the best American schools -- from Harvard to Columbia.

I'm a Kotlin lover and I have experience with native Android and native iOS development, as well as cross-platform development with React Native, Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform.

In my spare time I write and maintain open source code, I share my dev experience by [writing on my blog](/posts), [speaking at confs](/talks) and organizing events with the Google Developer Group Venezia and I play basketball.
