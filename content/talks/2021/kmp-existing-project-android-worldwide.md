abstract: After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. Thatâ€™s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).<br><br>This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform, and even though it is still in alpha, you can already start to use it in production applications.<br><br>In this talk, we will understand which part of the code can be a starting point for sharing, how to consume the shared code and how to structure an existing project to have an as smooth as possible integration.
