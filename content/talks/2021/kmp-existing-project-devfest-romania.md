## Abstract:

After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. Thatâ€™s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).

This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform, and even though it is still in alpha, you can already start to use it in production applications.

In this talk, we will understand which part of the code can be a starting point for sharing, how to consume the shared code and how to structure an existing project to have an as smooth as possible integration.
