title: "From Kotlin to Native and back: accessing native macOS API in Compose Multiplatform"
location: "droidcon Berlin"
performDate: 2025-09-25
eventUrl: https://berlin.droidcon.com/speakers/marco-gomiero
summary: "Compose Multiplatform makes it easy to build cross-platform desktop apps with Kotlin and Compose, but what about native APIs, like iCloud on macOS? Accessing such APIs isn't possible through the regular Compose Multiplatform toolchain. However, with a bit of \"magic\", we can turn dreams (or feature requests) into reality.
<br><br>
In this talk, we'll explore how to combine Kotlin/Native and the JNI (Java Native Interface) to bridge the gap between a JVM-based UI and native system features. We'll write Kotlin code, compile it into a native library, and call it back from Kotlin.
<br><br>
You'll learn how to build Kotlin/Native code into a native macOS dynamic library and integrate it into a Compose Multiplatform desktop app, unlocking access to iCloud and enabling features like backup and restore for your appâ€™s data."
