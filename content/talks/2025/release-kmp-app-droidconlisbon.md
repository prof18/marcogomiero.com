title: "The rollercoaster of releasing an Android, iOS and desktop app with Kotlin Multiplatform"
location: "droidcon Lisbon"
performDate: 2025-09-04
eventUrl: https://www.lisbon.droidcon.com/speakers
summary: "With the rise of Kotlin Multiplatform, the possibility of expanding to multiple platforms has increased, especially for Android Developers. It's easier than before to build for other platforms.
<br><br>
But how to release your app to multiple platforms?
<br><br>
In this talk, I will share all the things I've learned around distributing FeedFlow, an Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux app built with Kotlin Multiplatform, coming from an Android development background.
<br><br>
We will cover the deployment of the binary, automating everything with CI, crash reporting, logging, internationalization, and all you need to know to successfully distribute your KMP app."
