## Abstract:
Nowadays the hype around Flutter is raising a lot. But what about the "(not so) old-fashioned" React Native? In this talk, we will see the basics and the differences between the two frameworks and which to choose. All this journey is based on the true story of an Android Developer that he wanted to explore the cross-platform jungle.
