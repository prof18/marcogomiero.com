abstract: If you want to start adopting Jetpack Compose in an existing, large codebase, worked on by multiple teams, you canâ€™t just add the dependency and start creating composables right away.
<br>
In such projects, there are already established conventions, processes, and architecture decisions that will be disrupted with such a revolutionary change as Compose, since it requires a mental model shift towards declarative patterns.
<br>
In this talk, we will show the process that led us to a harmless integration of Compose into the TIER application, focusing on tooling, architectural changes, the evolution of our design system, and how we managed to get our developers onboard for all of the above.
