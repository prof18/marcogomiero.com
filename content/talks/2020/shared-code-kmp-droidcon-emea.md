## Abstract:
Kotlin Multiplatform is an experimental feature that you can use to share code between different platforms. Even if it is an experimental feature, it is already possible to start using it in production applications.

In this talk, I will share the discussion that led us to Kotlin Multiplatform, and the following processes we put in place to start using it in production for an Android, iOS, and backend project. I will show you what parts of the code you can (gradually) start to share and how to integrate with existing standalone projects.
