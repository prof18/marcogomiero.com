abstract: Nowadays, App modularization is a technique largely adopted that gives lots of advantages. But how to approach it?<br>This talk will not focus on the pro and cons of modularization but instead on the approach and the process to achieve it. In particular, I want to share the approach that I followed to modularize an existing application and a new one. I want also to share the failures and all the struggles that came in my head while approaching the process.
