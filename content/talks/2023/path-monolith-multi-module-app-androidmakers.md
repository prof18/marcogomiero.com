abstract: Going from a monolith to a multi-module project is a long process, that requires careful planning and a well-thought strategy, especially in medium-large teams.<br><br>The TIER application is evolving to a multi-module structure and this talk will be the logbook of the journey, covering the approach that we followed and the philosophy behind the choices that weâ€™ve made with both the mobile platforms in mind.<br><br>I will tell you how to balance the entire process without harming the regular feature delivery schedule, where to start modularizing and improvements to the build tools to make life less miserable.
