title: "Beyond one platform: migrating an Android library to Kotlin Multiplatform"
location: "Berlindroid"
performDate: 2023-08-30
eventUrl: https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/berlindroid/events/289853455/
summary: Back in 2016, out of my raising passion for Android development, I started working on RSSParser, a library for parsing RSS feeds on Android. Nowadays, out of my passion for Kotlin Multiplatform, I decided to make RSSParser Multiplatform... How hard can it be?
<br><br>
In this talk, I will share the journey of expanding an Android library into the iOS and JVM world. We will cover the challenges faced during the process, including how to handle platform-specific dependencies, code organization, and testing strategies. 
<br><br>
By the end of this talk, you'll have a better understanding of the benefits and challenges of creating a Kotlin Multiplatform library, and you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools you need to conquer the Multiplatform world!
