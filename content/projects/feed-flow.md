FeedFlow is a minimal, uncluttered RSS reader available on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux.

Minimalist design to keep the focus on what matters; seamless sync across devices with iCloud (iOS/macOS), Dropbox or Google Drive; FreshRSS, Miniflux, Feedbin and BazQux integration; flexible reading with reader mode or a preferred browser.

FeedFlow is built with Jetpack Compose, Compose Multiplatform, and SwiftUI, with shared logic via Kotlin Multiplatform, and uses [RSSParser](https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser), a multiplatform RSS parsing library I built.
