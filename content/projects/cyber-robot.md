This Android application has been developed during an University Class and the aim was to provide a "brain" to the Cyber Robot, a cheap sensorless toy robot sell by Clementoni. More information about the robot can be found [on the official website](https://www.amazon.it/Scienza-e-Gioco-13941-Clementoni/dp/B010VB0IQS). More specifically, the aim was to reverse-engineer the communication protocol of the robot via the Bluetooth HCI snoop log and then build an app that guides it to reach a target object that is framed by the phoneâ€™s camera. For more information about the communication protol, visit the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/prof18/CyberRobotBrain/wiki/How-to-move-Cyber-Robot).
