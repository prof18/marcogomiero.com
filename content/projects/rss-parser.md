RSS Parser is a Kotlin Multiplatform library for parsing RSS, Atom and RDF feeds. It supports Android, JVM, iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, wasmJS and JS.

The library can fetch and parse feeds from a URL or from an XML string. It is published on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.prof18.rssparser/rssparser). [FeedFlow](https://feedflow.dev) uses it for multiplatform RSS parsing.
