Spoton is a WearOS application that simplifies mobile hotspot management by allowing users to control their phone's hotspot directly from their smartwatch. 

The app consists of two components:
- A WearOS app that provides a simple interface to toggle the hotspot
- A companion Android phone app that handles the background communication

With Spoton, users can enable or disable their phone's mobile hotspot with a single tap on their watch, eliminating the need to take out and unlock their phone. This is particularly useful when frequently switching the hotspot on and off for connecting laptops, tablets, or other devices.

Spoton has been covered on [Android Police](https://www.androidpolice.com/spoton-app-toggle-hotspot-from-wear-os-smartwatch/).

**Deprecation:** The app has been sunset. Android 16 removed the ability to toggle the hotspot via the hidden APIs Spoton relied on. I wrote about the decision and the technical details in [Sunsetting spoton: Android 16 killed the hotspot toggle trick](/posts/2025/spoton-sunset).
