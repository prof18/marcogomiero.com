Spoton is a WearOS application that simplifies mobile hotspot management by allowing users to control their phone's hotspot directly from their smartwatch. 

The app consists of two components:
- A WearOS app that provides a simple interface to toggle the hotspot
- A companion Android phone app that handles the background communication

With Spoton, users can enable or disable their phone's mobile hotspot with a single tap on their watch, eliminating the need to take out and unlock their phone. This is particularly useful when frequently switching the hotspot on and off for connecting laptops, tablets, or other devices.
