Shellporter is a macOS menu bar utility that opens a terminal in the project directory of the active IDE window with a single global hotkey or a click from the menu bar. It requires macOS 14 or later and Accessibility permission.

Supported IDEs include JetBrains (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Fleet), VS Code, Cursor, Xcode, and Antigravity. Supported terminals include Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty, and a custom command option. Hotkeys and terminal are configurable in Settings. A second hotkey copies the project path to the clipboard. The app runs entirely on the machine; no network calls, telemetry, or analytics.
