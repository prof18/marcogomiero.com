MoneyFlow is a Kotlin Multiplatform personal finance app targeting Android and iOS with Compose Multiplatform. The app is in the middle of a rewrite with an updated architecture to better support Compose Multiplatform and keep the Android and iOS shells thin; the shared module is the source of truth.

Planned and in-progress features include transaction entry and list, edit transaction, custom categories, recap screen with plots, budgeting, CSV import and export, currency selection, and lock view with biometrics. Progress can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/prof18/MoneyFlow).
