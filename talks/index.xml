      <title>Forging the path from monolith to multi-module app</title>
      <link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/path-monolith-multi-module-app-droidcon-berlin/</link>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/path-monolith-multi-module-app-droidcon-berlin/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: Going from a monolith to a multi-module project is a long process, that requires careful planning and a well-thought strategy, especially in medium-large teams.
The TIER application is evolving to a multi-module structure and this talk will be the logbook of the journey, covering the approach that we followed and the philosophy behind the choices that we’ve made with both the mobile platforms in mind.
I will tell you how to balance the entire process without harming the regular feature delivery schedule, where to start modularizing and improvements to the build tools to make life less miserable.</description>

      <title>Imperative is dead, long live Declarative!</title>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/imperative-vs-declarative-appdevcon/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: Nowadays, the mobile world has started to see larger adoption of the declarative style to build UI as opposed to the (not so) old imperative style. This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.</description>

      <title>From Mobile to Backend with Kotlin and Ktor</title>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/from-mobile-to-backend-ktor-droidcon-webinar/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: As mobile developers, we often see the backend world as something magical that &amp;ldquo;does things&amp;rdquo;. But what if I tell you that you can easily build a backend even if mobile is your thing?
With this talk, I want to show how it is possible to bring your mobile knowledge (and shift it a little bit) to build a backend with Kotlin and Ktor. I will show how to structure the project, set up Dependency Injection, connect to a database and test everything to have a working backend ready to be deployed.</description>

      <title>Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project</title>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/kmp-existing-project-kotlin-dev-day/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. That’s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).
This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform, and even though it is still in alpha, you can already start to use it in production applications.
In this talk, we will understand which part of the code can be a starting point for sharing, how to consume the shared code and how to structure an existing project to have an as smooth as possible integration.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Kotlin Multiplatform is an alpha feature that you can use to share code between different platforms. Even if it is in alpha stage, it is already possible to start using it in production applications.
In this talk, I will share the discussion that led us to Kotlin Multiplatform, and the following processes we put in place to start using it in production for an Android, iOS, and backend project. I will show you what parts of the code you can (gradually) start to share and how to integrate with existing standalone projects.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day, even if it&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha. We constantly read of new companies and teams that are trying KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: it safe to do so? Why picking KMP over any another cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects? In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll answer to these questions, clarifying all the doubts and making you ready to use and love Kotlin Multiplatform.</description>

      <title>Flutter or React Native, a cross-platform dilemma</title>

      <description>Abstract: Nowadays the hype around Flutter is raising a lot. But what about the “(not so) old-fashioned” React Native? In this talk, we will see the basics and the differences between the two frameworks. In particular, we will understand how to build User Interfaces and how the internals of the two framework works. Finally, we will try to understand when and why to choose a cross-platform framework and which of the two.</description>

      <guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2019/kotlin-everywhere-venezia/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: In this talk, we will see how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to create a mobile application for Android and iOs that share some code (for example business logic, network, etc.) using Kotlin Platform. We will show a real application that we have built for this talk, i.e. a showcase app for the GDG Venezia.
We will show also how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to create a backend for this app by of course using Kotlin!</description>
