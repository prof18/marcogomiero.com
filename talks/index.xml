Abstract: Nowadays, the mobile world has started to see larger adoption of the declarative style to build UI as opposed to the (not so) old imperative style. This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/kmp-existing-project-kotlin-dev-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/kmp-existing-project-kotlin-dev-day/</guid><description>19 May 2022 - Kotlin Dev Day Amsterdam
Abstract: After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. That’s because, the possibility to start with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare).
This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform, and even though it is still in alpha, you can already start to use it in production applications.</description></item><item><title>From Mobile to Backend with Kotlin and Ktor</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/from-mobile-to-backend-ktor-fosdem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2022/from-mobile-to-backend-ktor-fosdem/</guid><description>6 February 2022 - FOSDEM
Abstract: As mobile developers, we often see the backend world as something magical that &amp;ldquo;does things&amp;rdquo;. But what if I tell you that you can easily build a backend even if mobile is your thing?
With this talk, I want to show how it is possible to bring your mobile knowledge (and shift it a little bit) to build a backend with Kotlin and Ktor. I will show how to structure the project, set up Dependency Injection, connect to a database and test everything to have a working backend ready to be deployed.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/kmp-existing-project-kotlin-budapest/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/kmp-existing-project-kotlin-budapest/</guid><description>14 December 2021 - Kotlin Budapest Meetup - December

Abstract: Kotlin Multiplatform is an alpha feature that you can use to share code between different platforms. Even if it is in alpha stage, it is already possible to start using it in production applications.
In this talk, I will share the discussion that led us to Kotlin Multiplatform, and the following processes we put in place to start using it in production for an Android, iOS, and backend project.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/kmp-existing-project-we-are-developers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/kmp-existing-project-we-are-developers/</guid><description>03 November 2021 - We Are Developers - Mobile Day

Abstract: Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day, even if it&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha. We constantly read of new companies and teams that are trying KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: it safe to do so? Why picking KMP over any another cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects?</description></item><item><title>Introducing Kotlin Multiplatform in an existing project</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/kmp-existing-project-android-worldwide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/kmp-existing-project-android-worldwide/</guid><description>26 October 2021 - Android Worldwide

Abstract: Nowadays, App modularization is a technique largely adopted that gives lots of advantages. But how to approach it? This talk will not focus on the pro and cons of modularization but instead on the approach and the process to achieve it. In particular, I want to share the approach that I followed to modularize an existing application and a new one. I want also to share the failures and all the struggles that came in my head while approaching the process.</description></item><item><title>Imperative is dead, long live Declarative!</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/imperative-vs-declarative-appdevcon-remote/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 17:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/imperative-vs-declarative-appdevcon-remote/</guid><description>12 November 2020 - AppDevCon Remote Event

Abstract: Nowadays the hype around Flutter is raising a lot. But what about the “(not so) old-fashioned” React Native? In this talk, we will see the basics and the differences between the two frameworks. In particular, we will understand how to build User Interfaces and how the internals of the two framework works.

Abstract: In this talk, we will see how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to create a mobile application for Android and iOs that share some code (for example business logic, network, etc.) using Kotlin Platform. We will show a real application that we have built for this talk, i.e. a showcase app for the GDG Venezia.
We will show also how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to create a backend for this app by of course using Kotlin!</description></item><item><title>Flutter or React Native, a cross-platform dilemma</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2019/flutter-rn-droidcon-ro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2019/flutter-rn-droidcon-ro/</guid><description>4-5 October 2019 - droidcon Transylvania
