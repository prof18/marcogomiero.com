      <description>After discovering a new interesting technology or framework, you will probably start asking yourself how to integrate it into an existing project. That&amp;rsquo;s because, the possibility of starting with a blank canvas is rare (not impossible, but rare). &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; This is also the case for Kotlin Multiplatform, which is getting more and more hype every day. And now, that the technology has become stable, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time to start using it! In this hands-on session, we will start with an existing Android and iOS application that &amp;ldquo;lives&amp;rdquo; in separate repositories, we will extract the business logic from the Android app and share it between the two apps with a Kotlin Multiplatform library. We will also cover how to distribute the library to the existing applications. By the end of this workshop, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better understanding of what is needed to start using Kotlin Multiplatform in your existing projects.</description>

      <description>As mobile developers, we often see the backend world as something magical that &amp;ldquo;does things&amp;rdquo;. But what if I tell you that you can easily build a backend even if mobile is your thing?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;With this talk, I want to show how it is possible to bring your mobile knowledge (and shift it a little bit) to build a backend with Kotlin and Ktor. I will show how to structure the project, set up Dependency Injection, connect to a database and test everything to have a working backend ready to be deployed.</description>

      <description>Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day. It started as an experimental technology, then alpha, beta and now it&amp;rsquo;s on the path of becoming stable. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; We constantly read of new companies and teams that are using KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: why pick KMP over any other cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll answer these questions, clarifying all the doubts and making you ready to use and love Kotlin Multiplatform.</description>

      <title>Adopting Jetpack Compose Safely</title>

      <description>If you want to start adopting Jetpack Compose in an existing, large codebase worked on by multiple teams, you can’t just add the dependency and start creating composables right away. In such projects, there are already established conventions and architectural decisions that such a revolutionary change might disrupt. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this talk, we will share our journey of integrating Compose into the TIER app while offering practical tips for tackling common challenges that arise when working with large-scale codebases, like: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Getting rid of Data binding,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Migrating to a Unidirectional Data Flow architecture,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Going Compose-first with a design system,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Enabling Compose in a multimodule world,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Getting Android engineers on board with the changes</description>

      <description>Going from a monolith to a multi-module project is a long process, that requires careful planning and a well-thought strategy, especially in medium-large teams.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;The TIER application is evolving to a multi-module structure and this talk will be the logbook of the journey, covering the approach that we followed and the philosophy behind the choices that we’ve made with both the mobile platforms in mind.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I will tell you how to balance the entire process without harming the regular feature delivery schedule, where to start modularizing and improvements to the build tools to make life less miserable.</description>

      <description>Back in 2016, out of my raising passion for Android development, I started working on RSSParser, a library for parsing RSS feeds on Android. Nowadays, out of my passion for Kotlin Multiplatform, I decided to make RSSParser Multiplatform&amp;hellip; How hard can it be? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this talk, I will share the journey of expanding an Android library into the iOS and JVM world. We will cover the challenges faced during the process, including how to handle platform-specific dependencies, code organization, and testing strategies. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; By the end of this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better understanding of the benefits and challenges of creating a Kotlin Multiplatform library, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools you need to conquer the Multiplatform world!</description>

      <description>Kotlin ecosystem is rapidly evolving over the years and 2022 was not an exception. Let&amp;rsquo;s gather to recap everything that happened with Kotlin in the past year and to have a closer look at the language roadmap: from the new K2 compiler, to stable Kotlin Multiplatform and beyond.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, the mobile world has started to see larger adoption of the declarative style to build UI as opposed to the (not so) old imperative style. This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, we will explore the declarative style of building UI compared with the imperative one. We will try to enter in this mindset by finding the differences and by looking at some examples of these patterns.</description>

      <description>Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day, even if it&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha. We constantly read of new companies and teams that are trying KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: it safe to do so? Why picking KMP over any another cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll answer to these questions, clarifying all the doubts and making you ready to use and love Kotlin Multiplatform.</description>

In this talk, Marco and Gian will go through what it means to work remotely for a startup &amp;ndash; from both a developer and a manager point of view. They&amp;rsquo;ll share some tips and tricks on how to stay organized and focused, how to manage deadlines and the team organization, how to take care of your mental health, and the pros and cons of hiring remotely. They both work for Uniwhere, a venture-backed startup that went remote-first more than two years ago and is now working with 4 different time-zones.</description>

This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In this talk, we will explore the declarative style of building UI compared with the imperative one.
