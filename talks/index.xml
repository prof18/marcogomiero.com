Abstract: Nowadays, the mobile world has started to see larger adoption of the declarative style to build UI as opposed to the (not so) old imperative style. This pattern is borrowed from the web world, from frameworks like React and Vue.js and it started to appear in the mobile world first with React Native, then with Flutter and finally, it captured the attention of the &amp;ldquo;native world&amp;rdquo; with Jetpack Compose and Swift UI.</description></item><item><title>And that, folks, is how we shared code between Android, iOS and the Backend</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/shared-code-kmp-fosdem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2021/shared-code-kmp-fosdem/</guid><description>7 February 2021 - FOSDEM
Abstract: Kotlin Multiplatform is an alpha feature that you can use to share code between different platforms. Even if it is in alpha stage, it is already possible to start using it in production applications.
In this talk, I will share the discussion that led us to Kotlin Multiplatform, and the following processes we put in place to start using it in production for an Android, iOS, and backend project.</description></item><item><title>Remote is here.

Abstract: Remote is finally here, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to stay. In this talk, Marco and Gian will go through what it means to work remotely for a startup &amp;ndash; from both a developer and a manager point of view. They&amp;rsquo;ll share some tips and tricks on how to stay organized and focused, how to manage deadlines and the team organization, how to take care of your mental health, and the pros and cons of hiring remotely.</description></item><item><title>Hi, have you met Kotlin Multiplatform</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/hi-met-kmp-mug/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2020 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/hi-met-kmp-mug/</guid><description>26 November 2020 - Marca User Group
Abstract: Kotlin Multiplatform is getting more and more hype every day, even if it&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha. We constantly read of new companies and teams that are trying KMP for experiments and production projects alike. And we&amp;rsquo;re left wondering: it safe to do so? Why picking KMP over any another cross-platform solution? How to approach it? And, most importantly, is it possible to start using it in existing projects?</description></item><item><title>7+1 tips about [Android] App Modularization</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/tips-modularization-droidcon-america/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/tips-modularization-droidcon-america/</guid><description>16-17 November 2020 - droidcon Americas
Abstract: Nowadays, App modularization is a technique largely adopted that gives lots of advantages. But how to approach it? This talk will not focus on the pro and cons of modularization but instead on the approach and the process to achieve it. In particular, I want to share the approach that I followed to modularize an existing application and a new one. I want also to share the failures and all the struggles that came in my head while approaching the process.</description></item><item><title>Imperative is dead, long live Declarative!</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/imperative-vs-declarative-appdevcon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 17:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2020/imperative-vs-declarative-appdevcon/</guid><description>12 November 2020 - AppDevCon

Abstract: In this talk, we will see how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to create a mobile application for Android and iOs that share some code (for example business logic, network, etc.) using Kotlin Platform. We will show a real application that we have built for this talk, i.e. a showcase app for the GDG Venezia.
We will show also how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to create a backend for this app by of course using Kotlin!</description></item><item><title>Flutter or React Native, a cross-platform dilemma</title><link>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2019/flutter-rn-droidcon-ro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcogomiero.com/talks/2019/flutter-rn-droidcon-ro/</guid><description>4-5 October 2019 - droidcon Transylvania
