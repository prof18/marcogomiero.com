In this roundtable, Android engineers and tech leads will share how they’re integrating AI tools like Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, and others into their Kotlin development workflows—from code generation to test scaffolding, refactoring, documentation, and more. We&rsquo;ll dig into what’s actually helpful in practice, how to avoid tool overload, and how to think critically about where AI fits into the developer experience.  Whether you’re experimenting with AI tooling or trying to get buy-in from your team, this is your space to compare notes, ask questions, and learn what’s working (and what’s not) in real-world Android development.  Which AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Gemini, Cursor) have you tried in your Android development workflow, and what stuck? What kinds of tasks—test generation, boilerplate reduction, code reviews—have you successfully offloaded to AI? How do you balance AI-generated code with code quality and maintainability in a Kotlin-heavy project? What risks or annoyances have you run into when trying to integrate AI into your daily work? Are your teams using AI collaboratively (e.g. shared prompts, memory banks, pair programming with AI), or is it still an individual tool?"><meta property="og:image" content><meta name=google-site-verification content="7rDTNqn214SsZ9mmV8Ps5v2vqy8aXFWyoq08udChYCs"><meta property="og:title" content="Roundtable: Working with AI, Not for AI: Practical Strategies for Android Development"><meta property="og:description" content="AI is reshaping how we write code—but for Android developers, the real question is: how do we make it genuinely useful, without slowing down, over-automating, or rewriting our process for the hype?
