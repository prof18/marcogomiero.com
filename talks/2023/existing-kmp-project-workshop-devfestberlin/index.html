And now, that the technology has become stable, it's the perfect time to start using it! In this hands-on session, we will start with an existing Android and iOS application that "lives" in separate repositories, we will extract the business logic from the Android app and share it between the two apps with a Kotlin Multiplatform library. We will also cover how to distribute the library to the existing applications.
