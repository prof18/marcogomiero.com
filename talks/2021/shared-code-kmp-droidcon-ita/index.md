# And that, folks, is how we shared code between Android, iOS and the Backend


11 November 2021 - [droidcon Italy](https://it.droidcon.com/2021/agenda/)

## Abstract:
Kotlin Multiplatform is an alpha feature that you can use to share code between different platforms. Even if it is in alpha stage, it is already possible to start using it in production applications.

In this talk, I will share the discussion that led us to Kotlin Multiplatform, and the following processes we put in place to start using it in production for an Android, iOS, and backend project. I will show you what parts of the code you can (gradually) start to share and how to integrate with existing standalone projects.
