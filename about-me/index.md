I'm working as Uniwhere Tech Lead, where I manage the end-to-end development of a platform with half a million users.

I'm a Kotlin lover with a Computer Engineering degree, I have experience with native Android and native iOS development, as well as cross-platform development with React Native, Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform.

In my spare time I write and maintain open source code, I share my dev experience by speaking at confs and organizing events with the Google Developer Group Venezia and I play basketball.
